## MAKEFILE EXAMPLE ##
######################
STEPS:
1.To make an executable file called "hello"
  Type the following command in the terminal
  g++ main.cpp function1.cpp function2.cpp -o hello

2. Step will return a file called "hello"

However, if you have too many cpp files,
it's NOT practical to write all the cpp files and add header files names.
To compile the files, "makefiles" is used!
